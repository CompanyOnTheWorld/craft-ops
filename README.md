# Craft Ops

`Craft Ops` is a template which uses automation tools to build you a virtual
DevOps environment which is tailored for [Craft CMS][craft_link]. Craft itself
is already incredibly easy to setup with tools like MAMP, and this project
aims to stay that way. This project's goal is to get you past the process
of dragging files over to FTP and using commands instead. Ideally you learn 
a thing or two about [Unix-like][unix_like_link] systems in the process.

To start, the ops workflows will be built around the use of AWS and Bitbucket.
These products both offer free options and can be fully automated.

Please also note that use of Craft is subject to their own
[license agreement][craft_license].

##### Requirements

You only need these tools installed, and both have builds for most systems.

- [Vagrant][vagrant_link]
- [VirtualBox][virtualbox_link]

> This has not been tested on Windows, but support is welcome :)

It is really easy, just clone this repo and `vagrant up` the `dev` box.
